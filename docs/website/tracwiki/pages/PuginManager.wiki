= Plugin Manager =

== Summary ==
Pulp's plugin manager is part of the [wiki:GenericContentDesign generic content] sub-system. Its purpose is to discover ''importers'' and ''distributors'' and associate them with different content types. It also manages any configuration files associated with the importers and distributors. It will also return the appropriate importer or distributor when given a content type.

== Requirements ==
 * Importer and distributor plugin discovery
 * ~~Support user-defined importer and distributor plugin location(s)~~
 * Per-plugin configuration file parsing
 * Support config-level "toggling" of plugins
 * Maintain association between plugins and content types
 * Return associated importer when given a content type
 * Return distributor when give distribution type

== On Startup ==
At start up, the plugin manager will look in a standard location for python modules that define either an importer or distributor. It will then dynamically load the module and ask it for its supported content types. If more than one importer or distributor is discovered for a single type, the plugin manager will log the error

== At Runtime ==
At runtime, the plugin manager will provide an api for instantiating importers and distributors based on the repo. It will also provide a query api that lists the available importers and distributors and the content/distribution types they support.
