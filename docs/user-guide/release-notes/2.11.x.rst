Pulp 2.11.0
===========

New Features
------------

* For RPM content, a full sync will be forced if the sync configuration has been changed or content
  has been removed since the last sync.

* When pulp-manage-db is run, prompt the user to continue if there are Pulp services still running.

* Memory improvements! Worker process recycling can be enabled to release unused memory back to
  the system after tasks complete. This feature is disabled by default. See the
  :ref:`process recycling documentation<process_recycling>` for more info. Thank you to Jan-Otto
