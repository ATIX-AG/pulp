Pulp 2.7 Release Notes
=========================

Pulp 2.7.0
===========

New Features
------------

- The repo authentication functionality previously associated with pulp_rpm has
  been moved to platform. This makes it available for other plugins to use.

- A new event notification framework is available. Please see
  :ref:`the developer documentation <event>` for more detail.


Bindings Changes
----------------

These are changes to the python bindings to pulp's REST API. This does not
affect most users.

User Create
~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``roles`` parameter to the user creation method was dropped. It was unused
on the server side, and as of 2.7.0, the REST API complains about unused data
passed in a POST request.
