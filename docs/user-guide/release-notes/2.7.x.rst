Pulp 2.7 Release Notes
=======================

Pulp 2.7.0
==========

New Features
------------

- Pulp now allows users to add their own :ref:`content authentication mechanisms <content_auth_mechanisms>`.

- Pulp now supports using basic authentication when syncing repositories. This
  can be enabled via ``--basicauth-user`` and ``--basicauth-pass`` when
  creating or updating repositories. Note that this also requires support in the
  plugin; currently only pulp_rpm supports this option.

- Pulp no longer returns proxy passwords or basic authentication passwords when
  viewing importer configurations.  Instead, ``*****`` is returned.
