Pulp 2.10.0
===========

New Features
------------

* Multiple instances of ``pulp_resource_manager`` can now exist in parallel without interfering with
  each other. The original copy will now hold an exclusive lock until it dies or is killed, at
  which point another instance of ``pulp_resource_manager`` can acquire the lock and take its place.
