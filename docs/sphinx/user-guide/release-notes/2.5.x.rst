Pulp 2.5 Release Notes
=========================

Pulp 2.5.1
===========

Rest API Changes
----------------

* The `Task Report` attribute `queue` is duplicated as the attribute `worker_name`. This is a
  backwards compatible change. The `queue` attribute will be removed from the `Task Report` in
  Pulp 3.0.0.

.. _2.5.0_upgrade_to_2.5.1:

Upgrade Instructions for 2.5.0 --> 2.5.1
-----------------------------------------

Prior to upgrading, all tasks must be stopped. One way to accomplish this is to stop all
`pulp_workers`, `pulp_celerybeat`, and `pulp_resource_manager` processes and then list the current
tasks using:

::

    pulp-admin tasks list

Any task that is in the "Running" or "Waiting" state should be canceled by its <uuid> using:

::

    pulp-admin tasks cancel --task-id <uuid>

After all tasks have been canceled upgrade the packages using:

::

    sudo yum update

After yum completes you should restart `httpd`, `pulp_workers`, `pulp_celerybeat`, and
`pulp_resource_manager`.


Pulp 2.5.0
