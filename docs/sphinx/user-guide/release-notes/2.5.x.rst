Pulp 2.5 Release Notes
=========================

Pulp 2.5.0
===========

New Features
------------

- pulp-admin now has a bash tab completion script.

- A new selinux policy that confines the pulp_workers, pulp_celerybeat, and
  pulp_resource_manager

- Pulp 2.5.0 includes `pulp_docker`, an optional plugin to manage Docker
  repositories. In Pulp 2.5.0 this optional plugin is considered "tech preview"
  and did not undergo the same level of testing as other plugins. Please
  refer to the
  `pulp_docker documentation <https://github.com/pulp/pulp_docker/tree/master/docs/user-guide>`_
  for usage information.

- Pulp now supports SSL on its connection to MongoDB. It is strongly recommended that you
  `configure MongoDB to perform SSL`_, and configure Pulp to require a validly signed certificate
  from Mongo. If you wish to do this, edit ``/etc/pulp/server.conf`` and configure ``ssl`` and
  ``verify_ssl`` to ``true`` in the ``[database]`` section.

.. _configure MongoDB to perform SSL: http://docs.mongodb.org/v2.4/tutorial/configure-ssl/#configure-mongod-and-mongos-for-ssl

Deprecation
-----------

- The `task_type` attribute of a `Task Report` is deprecated with Pulp 2.5.0.  This attribute will
  be removed in a future release.
