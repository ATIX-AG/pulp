Below is the template used for a single API. Things to keep in mind:

* For response_list and sample_request, the `_` part is required.
* For sample_request, make sure to have a space after the ` and before ::
* Variables in a path are denoted by <> (e.g. /repositories/<repo_id>/)
* Order response codes in ascending order
* A ? at the start of a param name will flag it as optional
* param_list takes the method value as an argument
* sample_response takes the code of the response being sampled
