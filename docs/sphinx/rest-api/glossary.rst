  distributor
    Server-side plugin that takes content from a repository and publishes it
    for consumption. The process by which a distributor publishes content varies
    based on the desired approach of the distributor. A repository may have
    more than one distributor associated with it at a given time.

  importer
    Server-side plugin that provides support for synchronizing content from an
    external source and importing that content into the Pulp server. Importers
    are added to repositories to define the supported functionality of that
    repository.
