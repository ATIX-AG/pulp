Issues:
=========================
1. Using ~/root/.pulp/user-cert.pem for REST call to upstream.
   Need something better.

2. How to deal with repo scratchpad.
   - not supported by REST API.

3. How to deal with coupling between importer/distributer
   via scratchpad.
     - yum importer uses scratchpad to communicate working_directory
       containing YUM metadata.

4. Need to deal with different root directories
   used for storage_path(s) on Units.  Differences in upstream & downstream
   server configuration as it pertains to this.
