The run.sh script will test your data from pulp < 2.8 to ensure that the
upgrade process will succeed. It requires you to creata a database dump. It
does not modify data in your running pulp server, nor does it modify the
contents of the database dump you provide.

The script starts a docker container running mongodb. It then starts a second
container that loads your database dump into the mongodb container, and then
runs the upgrade test script. At the end, both containers are stopped and
removed.


Requirements
------------

Docker
Dump of pulp database from mongodb


Usage
-----

1. Create an empty directory, and use it as the working directory for all further steps.

2. Download the run.sh script found near this README.

3. Use mongodump to create a dump of your pulp database. This will create a
subdirectory called "dump". On EL6 and EL7, mongodump is found in package
"mongodb".  On Fedora, it is in package "mongo-tools".

For usage, see the documentation link below. In the simplest use case:
mongodump --db pulp_database

4. If selinux is enforcing, run this command so the docker container will have
access to the dumped files: sudo chcon -Rt svirt_sandbox_file_t dump 

5. sudo ./run.sh

Progress information will appear on your screen, and that same data will be
written to disk in a file whose name starts with "upgrade_validation-". If there are any errors,
please share that log file with the pulp team. You can file an issue here:
