 # Sometimes, a nightly compose is incomplete and does not contain a Vagrant image, so you may need
 # to browse that repository a bit to find the latest successful Vagrant image. For example, at the
 # time of this writing, I could set this setting like this for the latest F24 image:

 # cache a synced folder. This is essentially what the vagrant-cachier plugin would do for us
 # if it supported dnf, and unfortunately that project is in need of maintainers so this might
 # be the best we can do for now. Note that you'll have to manually create the '.dnf-cache'
 # directory in the same directory as this Vagrantfile for this to work.
