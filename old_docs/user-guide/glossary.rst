  binding
    An association between a :term:`consumer` and a :term:`repository`
    :term:`distributor` for the purpose of installing :term:`content units <content unit>`
    on the specified consumer.

  bundle
    Term used to denote the collection of server and client components to
    provide support for a particular set of content types. For example, support
    for handling RPMs and errata is provided by the RPM bundle whereas support
    for Puppet modules is provided by the Puppet bundle.

  CLI
    Command Line Interface

  consumer
    A managed system that is the consumer of content.  Consumption refers
    to the installation of software contained within a :term:`repository` and
    published by an associated :term:`distributor`.

  content unit
    An individual piece of content managed by the Pulp server. A unit does not
    necessarily correspond to a file. It is possible that a content unit is
    defined as the aggregation of other content units as a grouping mechanism.

  distributor
    Server-side plugin that takes content from a repository and publishes it
    for consumption. The process by which a distributor publishes content varies
    based on the desired approach of the distributor. A repository may have
    more than one distributor associated with it at a given time.

  download policy
    The method used to retrieve content for a repository. There are three
    possible policies: The :term:`immediate download policy`,
    :term:`background download policy`, and :term:`on-demand download policy`.
    Both the :term:`background download policy` and the
    :term:`on-demand download policy` are :term:`deferred download policies`.

  immediate download policy
    The default download policy for :term:`repositories <repository>`. When
    using this policy, all content is downloaded before publishing the repository.

  background download policy
    A download policy that actively retrieves :term:`content units <content unit>`
    in the background after a publish has been performed.

  on-demand download policy
    A download policy that only saves a :term:`content unit <content unit>`
    locally after a client has requested that content unit.

  deferred download policies
    Download policies that do not require all :term:`content units <content unit>`
    to be downloaded locally to publish the :term:`repository <repository>`.

  extension
    Client-side component that augments the CLI with new functionality. While
    all functionality in the client is provided through extensions, this term
    is typically used to refer to content type specific extensions provided
    by a content type bundle.

  importer
    Server-side plugin that provides support for synchronizing content from an
    external source and importing that content into the Pulp server. Importers
    are added to repositories to define the supported functionality of that
    repository.

  iso8601
    ISO Date format that is able to specify an optional number of recurrences,
    an optional start time, and a time interval. More information can be
    found :ref:`in the conventions section of this guide <date-and-time>`.

  registration
    The association of a :term:`consumer` to a Pulp server.  Once registered,
    a consumer is added to Pulp's inventory and may be :term:`bound <binding>` to
    Pulp provided :term:`repositories <repository>`.

  repository
    A collection of content units. A repository's supported types is dictated
    by the configured :term:`importer`. A repository may have multiple
    :term:`distributors <distributor>` associated which are used to publish
    its content to multiple destinations, formats, or protocols.

  unit profile
    A list of :term:`content unit` installed on a :term:`consumer`.  The
    structure and content of each item in the profile varies based on the
    unit type.
