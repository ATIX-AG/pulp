Pulp 3 Release Notes
=======================

Pulp 3
======

Changelog
---------

* Nodes are no longer supported and were completely removed with
  Pulp 3.0. Instead of using nodes, publish content from one Pulp server
  and use that feed url to sync the content into another Pulp server.
  This is the recommended approach for a nodes use case.
