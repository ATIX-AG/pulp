# Pulp server configuration
#
# Values shown are the default values used, unless otherwise indicated.


# `allowed_hosts`: A list of strings representing the host/domain names that
# Pulp can serve. This is a security measure to prevent HTTP Host header
# attacks. A value beginning with a period can be used as a sub-domain wildcard.
# The default is the host's FQDN.
#
# allowed_hosts:
#   - pulp.example.com

# `databases`: An associative array (dictionary) of databases to use. For the
# full list of configuration options, refer to the Django database documentation
# shipped with your version of Django, or online at
# https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/ref/settings/#databases
#
# By default, Pulp will attempt to connect to PostgreSQL on a local Unix
# socket using the 'pulp' user with a database name of 'pulp'.
