Pulp requires celery 3.1, which is not available in Fedora <= 20 or EPEL 6.

For Pulp to use SSL with Celery, Celery bug celery/celery#1973 needs to be
fixed.  A PR celery/celery#1975 has been submitted upstream, but not yet
merged.  This patch is introduced through the spec file, and can be removed
once:

1.  celery/celery#1975 is merged upstream.
2.  celery/celery#1975  is included in a Kombu release
3.  This dependency is updated to the release containing celery/celery#1975
