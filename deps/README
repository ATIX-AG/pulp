This README tracks Pulp dependencies. For each dependency it includes the following:

* Who maintains it
* What version Pulp requires
* If the version requires patches, and if so, what each patch performs
* What platforms the necessary dependency is not available on


createrepo
----------

Team owner: jcline

Note: createrepo-0.9.9 is available in EL6 and EL7. createrepo-0.10.3 is available in F21+

The createrepo patch carried appears to be related to a problem in anaconda-13.21.195-1.el6[0].
Based on the bug report against Pulp, this is only a problem for RHEL6[1]. It's possible this
was fixed in Fedora as early as F18[2].

mod_wsgi
--------

Team owner: dkliban

pulp requires 3.4, which is not available in EPEL 6.

TODO: why does pulp need 3.4?


python-amqp
-----------

Team owner: bmbouter

kombu 3.0.24 requires amqp>=1.4.6,<2.0, which is not available in EPEL <= 7, or Fedora <= 20.

This requirement may not actually be necessary if amqp becomes available on the necessary platforms [0].

python-billiard
---------------

Team owner: bmbouter

celery-3.1.11 requires billiard>=3.3.0.17,<3.4, and a new-enough version is not available in
Fedora <= 20 or EPEL <= 7.


python-celery
-------------

Team owner: bmbouter

Pulp requires celery 3.1, which is not available in Fedora <= 20 or EPEL <= 7.


python-isodate
---------------

Team owner: jcline

This appears to be unmaintained upstream, and there is no knowledge of why we have
a patch. This version is newer than what is in Fedora <= 20 and EPEL <= 7, so we should
consider using a different library.


python-kombu
------------

Team owner: bmbouter

Celery 3.1.11 requires kombu>=3.0.15,<4.0, which is not in Fedora <= 20,
or EPEL <= 7.

Pulp would like to use the Qpid transport which is available in upstream
kombu>=3.0.24


Permanent Patches:

1212200.patch - This patch will need to continue to be with us forever as
                it works around a permanent downstream issue whereby
                ordereddict is installed as part of the Python system
                library, and not in site-packages. This is not
                contributed to upstream Kombu. For more info, see:
                https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1212200#c7


Temporary Patches:

This are contributed to upstream Kombu and will be included in a future
release of Kombu, but until it is we include it in downstream.

qpid_fixes.patch - Fixes the following issues:

* Fixes close bug where the connection was not being closed.
  This fixes https://github.com/celery/kombu/issues/455

* Fixes file descriptor leak issue.
  https://github.com/celery/kombu/issues/476

* Fixes a sasl auth mechanism issue.

python-mongoengine
------------------

Team owner: rbarlow

Pulp uses a vanilla version of mongoengine 0.9.0, except for one
patch which removes Pillow as a setuptools dependency. Not
having Pillow installed at runtime will disable the ImageField,
but mongoengine will operate fully otherwise. At the time I built
mongoengine 0.9.0, Pillow is not available on EL6.

python-mongoengine requires at least pymongo 2.7.1 at runtime.

The spec file was originally adapted from the spec file inside of
python-mongoengine-0.8.4-3.el7.src.rpm [0].

python-nectar
-------------

Team owner: ipanova

This is required by pulp and authored by the pulp team. Once pulp building is
moved into koji, this can probably be removed as a dep and build through normal
koji means.


python-pymongo
--------------

Team owner: rbarlow

Pulp currently uses a vanilla version of pymongo 2.7.2. That is
the latest Z release for the pymongo 2.7 release stream.

python-mongoengine requires at least pymongo 2.7.1 at runtime.

The spec file was originally adapted from the spec file inside of
python-pymongo-2.5.2-7.fc23.src.rpm [0]. Thanks also to dgoodwin
and Dominic in #tito for the spec file help.

python-rhsm
-----------

Team owner: asmacdo

pulp requires python-rhsm, which is not available in CentOS 6 or 7. We do not currently carry
the most recent version of python-rhsm. If it is found that we need to, we can update.


python-sematic-version
----------------------

Team owner: mhrivnak

This is required for pulp-puppet-plugins.

This is not currently in epel <= 7 or fedora <= 20.

There are no known restrictions on what version to use.

The plan is to get this into Fedora and EPEL. Review request: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1077030
