Celery 3.1.9 requires kombu>=3.0.12,<4.0, which is not in Fedora<=20 or EPEL 6.

The Kombu dep we use is 3.0.13, which is a version newer than Celery 3.1.9
requires, but it seems to work well enough, and the Kombu changelog supports
that conclusion also.  The next time Celery is updated, we will update Kombu to
the recommended version so they are more syncrhonized.

Pulp would like to use the Qpid transport through a PR celery/kombu#335 that
has been submitted upstream, but not yet merged.  This patch is introduced
through the spec file, and can be removed once:

1.  celery/kombu#335 is merged upstream.
2.  celery/kombu#335 is included in a Kombu release
3.  This dependency is updated to the release containing celery/kombu#335.
