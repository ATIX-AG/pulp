Celery 3.1.9 requires kombu>=3.0.13,<4.0, which is not in Fedora<=20 or EPEL 6.
Furthermore, Pulp would like to use the Qpid transport through a patch that has
not yet been accepted in upstream Kombu.  Currently, this build packages
vanilla kombu==3.0.13 and then applies the patch contained in
qpid_transport.patch
