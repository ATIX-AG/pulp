"""
Contains protocol handlers for retrieving puppet modules from various
sources. Each downloader class must implement the following methods:

retrieve_metadata(config)
  Returns the contents of the source's metadata file describing available modules.

retrieve_module(config, module_metadata, destination)
  Copies the specified module bits into the given location. This may involve
  downloading the module from an external source.
