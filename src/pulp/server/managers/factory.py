"""
Provides a loosely coupled way of retrieving references into other manager
instances. Test cases can manipulate this module to mock out the class of
manager returned for a given type to isolate and simulate edge cases such
as exceptions.

When changing manager class mappings for a test, be sure to call reset()
in the test clean up to restore the mappings to the defaults. Failing to
do so may indirectly break other tests.
