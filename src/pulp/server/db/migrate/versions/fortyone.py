ID for repositories %s contains characters which are not supported by Yum as a repository title in a '.repo' file.
Because of this, you may see an error when installing a package from these repositories on a consumer. You can either 
manually update consumer's .repo file to update title, or delete and create a new repository that follows new ID restriction. 
Repository ID may now contain only numbers(0-9), upper and lower case letters(A-Z, a-z), hyphens(-), underscore(_) and periods(.)
