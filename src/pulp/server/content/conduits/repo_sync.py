"""
Contains the definitions for all classes related to the importer's API for
interacting with the Pulp server during a repo sync.

Plugin implementations for repository sync will obviously vary wildly. For help
in understanding the APIs, below is a short outline of a common sync process and
its calls into this conduit:

1. Call get_units to understand what units are already associated with the
   repository being synchronized.
2. For each new unit to add to the Pulp server and associate with the repository,
   the plugin takes the following steps.:
   a. Calls init_unit which takes unit specific metadata and allows Pulp to
      populate any calculated/derived values for the unit. The result of this
      call is an object representation of the unit.
   b. Uses the storage_path field in the returned unit to save the bits for the
      unit to disk.
   c. Calls save_unit which creates/updates Pulp's knowledge of the content unit
      and creates an association between the unit and the repository
   d. If necessary, calls link_unit to establish any relationships between units.
3. For units previously associated with the repository (known from get_units)
   that should no longer be, calls remove_unit to remove that association.

Throughout the sync process, the set_progress call can be used to update the
Pulp server on the status of the sync. Pulp will make this information available
to users.
