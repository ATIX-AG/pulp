Pulp is a content management system for repositories and collections of
repositories.
TODO (2010-05-19 jconnor) fill out more of this intro...

= Components ==================================================================

Pulp consists of three discrete components:

1. Persistent meta data store. Pulp is currently backed by MongoDB.
2. Pulp Library. Implemented as a Python runtime library.
3. Web Services. Either a standalone daemon, 'juicer', or can be deployed behind
   Apache using mod_wsgi. 

= Getting Started =============================================================

Requirements: The following packages must first be installed:
1. MongoDB: (mongo and mongo-server) mongo database server and client utilities
2. PyMongo: (python-pymongo) python-mongo bindings
3. Greenlet: (python-greenlet) python user-space micro-threads
4. Gevent: (python-gevent) python micro-threaded http server w/ ssl support
           based on libevent
5. Grinder: (grinder) python RHN and Yum repository synchronization
6. Web.py: (python-webpy) simple python webframework

All of these packages can be found as rpm's in the yum repo (or from fedora):
http://admiyo.fedorapeople.org/pulp-repo/

Cut & Paste this as a yum repo file (pulp.repo):
[pulp]
name=pulp
baseurl=http://admiyo.fedorapeople.org/pulp-repo/
gpgcheck=0
enabled=1


Installing Pulp:
To install Pulp, run the setup.py file as root:
python src/setup.py install
or
python src/setup.py develop
to have the installed library point to your git repository. This allows the
installed library to instantly pickup on changes made in your check and is the
recommended installation for developers.


Services: The following services must be started:
1. MongoDB (as root): /sbin/service mongod start
2. Juicer (the pulp web services daemon): juicer -c etc/juicer.ini

You will now have the webservices listening on the loopback at port 8811. Please
check out the API documentation.
